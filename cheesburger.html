  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>I know you know how to make a cheeseburger … but as it turns out, I have some tips you might find useful! From the best beef to the best bun to the best cheese, today’s burger recipe also comes with your choice of burger sauces: a tomato one or my quick creamy Special Burger Sauce. Plus, homemade fries!</p>

  <p>The only questions left are really, single or double cheeseburger?? Stove or BBQ??</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2.4 lb beef mince (ground beef)</li>
    <li>4 soft burger buns or rolls</li>
    <li>4 slices burger cheese</li>
    <li>8 cos/romaine lettuce leaves</li>
    <li>2 large tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 red onion</li>
    <li>2 large gherkins</li>
    <li>ketchup</li>
    <li>mustard</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Patties: Separate the beef into 4 equal portions, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers (do it!). Gently roll each portion into balls then press down into round patties that are slightly larger than your bun to allow for shrinkage (12 cm / 4.7" wide, 1 cm / 0.4" thick for a 10cm / 4" burger bun).</li>
    <li>Toast buns: Preheat the grill to high. Place the bread cut face up on a tray and toast for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. (If using BBQ, place cut face down on the grill). Set aside.</li>
    <li>Slather the base of the bun with your sauce of choice. My order of assembly: lettuce, tomato, burger (x 2 for double!), gherkins, onion, sauce on bun lid, jam it on top of the stack.</li>
    <li>DEVOUR with French Fries on the side.
    </li>
  </ol>
